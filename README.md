# About

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface. It includes many web standards from WHATWG [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/).

The goal of [Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering.

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) focuses heavily on performance and can be used as an alternative to [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).
